# ⚡ ShadowFlow — The Transparent Sidecar Load Balancer

**Work In Progress**

Deploy beside your app. Balance traffic. Zero code changes. Zero config drama.

ShadowFlow runs silently as a sidecar proxy, intercepting and intelligently routing L4/L7 traffic — while your app sleeps peacefully, unaware of the storm it just weathered.
